auth_scheme: "native"
```

Loading a YAML file.
```go
yaml, err := ioutil.ReadFile("account.yml")
if err != nil {
    logger.Error(err)
    panic(err)
}

account, err := types.CreateIRODSAccountFromYAML(yaml)
if err != nil {
    logger.Error(err)
    panic(err)
}
```

## FileSystem Interface
Creating a file system object with default configurations.
```go
appName := "delete_file"
filesystem, err := fs.NewFileSystemWithDefault(account, appName)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
defer filesystem.Release()
```

Deleting a file and double check the file existance.
```go
err = filesystem.RemoveFile("/iplant/home/iychoi/test", true) // do it forcefully
if err != nil {
    logger.Error(err)
    panic(err)
}

if !filesystem.ExistsFile("/iplant/home/iychoi/test") {
    fmt.Printf("Successfully deleted file\n")
} else {
    fmt.Printf("Could not delete file\n")
}
```

Downloading a file.
```go
err = filesystem.DownloadFile("/iplant/home/iychoi/test", "", "/opt", nil) // download a file from default resource ("") to /opt local dir
if err != nil {

    panic(err)
}
```
